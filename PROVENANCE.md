# Code Provenance (Tooling Context)

Initial development used AI-assisted tooling (GitHub Copilot / raptor-mini) for early
scaffolding and mechanical edits. Subsequent development, review, and refactoring used
OpenAI Codex-class models for invariant reasoning and test hardening.

All semantic behavior is governed by deterministic code, fixtures, and tests; no AI
system participates in runtime decisions.
